# Anuran-Species-Project


A study of development of the frog population to enhance its protection strategy. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeefficient (MFCCs) are a well-known characteristics for identifying frog sounds. The dataset was utilised in a variety of classification tasks linked to the difficulty of recognizing anuran species based on their sounds. The recordings were stored in wav format with 44.1kHz of sampling frequency and 32 bit of resolution. In this project, we seek to find if machine learning can be a useful tool in classifying frog calls and also to find which features reduction technique is used in machine learning that can reduce the number of features or reduce data dimensions before classifictaion without losing majority of the data.
